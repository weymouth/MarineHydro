# Marine Hydrodynamics with Jupyter Notebooks

The repository holds the code and notebooks for the *Marine Hydrodynamics* course at The University of Southampton, taught by [Gabriel Weymouth](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/about/staff/gdw1d12.page) and Dominic Hudson. The course covers analytical, numerical and experimental methods for water waves and wave-body motion. 

These notebooks assume the student is already familiar with Python. Please review the notebooks and Youtube playlist [Introduction to Numerical Python for Engineers](https://github.com/weymouth/NumericalPython) if needed.
