    "# Assignment 1(a): Roll added-inertia of a submerged body\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will extend the functions from the panel method notebook to predict the flow and forces induced by **roll motion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Sketch_ a body subject to roll motion $\\Omega_z=U_6$ around the point $(x_m,y_m)$. _Determine_ the equation for the normal velocity $\\vec U \\cdot \\hat n$ at a point $(x,y)$ on the body. Using this, _define_ the RHS of the body boundary condition $ \\frac{\\partial\\phi_6}{\\partial n} = b_6$. _Define_ the equation for the roll added-inertia $m_{66}$ in terms of these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Implement_ a function `roll` which takes in the coordinate arrays `x,y` defining a shape and the roll center `xm,ym` and returns the source strength vector `q6` and added-inertia `m66`. Make sure you _explain_ the linear algebra equations for you have implemented for `q6,m66`.  _Validate_ the `roll` function by comparing to a known $m_{66}$ for a fully submerged shape (cite your reference) and _discuss_ the convergence behaviour. _Plot_ the induced flow and _discuss_ it's physical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Due 23:59, 24 Feb 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write-up your solution for both Q1 & 2 and submit as a `PDF` or `HTML`. *Note:* If you make a `PDF`, you need to include images of important functions and the results plots. Exporting a notebook as `HTML` will contain everything automatically.\n",
    "* Submit the working python code needed to reproduce those plots as a `PY` or `IPYNB`. *Note:* Explain your method/results in the write-up, not in the code. Any time you are tempted to write \"see code for ____\", put the important information in the write-up instead."
